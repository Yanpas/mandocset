# mandocset

python script mandocset.py takes folder with man pages. First it finds all folders, containing digit in their name, then runs `man2html` util for each of them.

Posix man pages were taken from ubuntu's package [manpages-posix](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/manpages-posix)
linux man pages were taken from linux's [git](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/)
